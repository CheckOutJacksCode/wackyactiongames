# Pygames Rock, Paper, Scissors

Includes a python pygames version of rock, paper, scissors that interacts with the mouse. Creates a network connection,
able to run two separate clients on pycharm, and two players can play against each other on the same network.

## Requires:
 -Python 3.6.1
 -Pygame 2.0.1

## Installation
Once Python 3.6.1 is installed onto your system, navigate to the directory where you want to install the game, then clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/CheckOutJacksCode/wack (if you don't have git, you can download the repository as a .zip). Then go into the folder (cd Minesweeper) and create virtual environment (venv) with python3 or python -m venv venv.

Activate the venv with source venv/bin/activate on MacOS or venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows. Install Pygame in the venv with pip install pygame.

Running
Whilst in the venv, run the command python3 ('python' works for me) main.py.

## Command-line Minesweeper

Just navigate inside of the 'command-line minesweeper' folder inside the main directory, and start the game from the command line with the command "python 'Final Minesweeper.py',
follow the prompts in the command line to set the grid size and number of bombs.
